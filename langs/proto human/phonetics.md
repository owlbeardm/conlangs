i, ɪ, e, ɛ, a; u, ʊ, o, ɔ

The open-mid vowels /ɛ, ɔ/ merge with /e, o/ in all unstressed contexts.
A further reduction is observed in intertonic syllables where /i, u/ merge with /ɪ, ʊ/.
Vowels are lengthened allophonically in stressed open syllables, although perhaps not /ɪ/ or /ʊ/.
/i, u/ become [j, w] between a consonant and following vowel. [j] then triggers palatalization, e.g. /basiáre/ [basʲáːɾe].

When palatalized /t, k, n, l/ become [tsʲ, c, ɲ, ʎ].[12][13]
Intervocalic [c, ɲ, ʎ] regularly geminate.[12] [tsʲ] does so only sporadically.[14]
Words beginning with /sC/ undergo prosthesis, e.g. /stáre/ [ɪstáːɾe], unless preceded by a vowel.[15][16]
It is debated whether /kʷ/ is its own phoneme or merely an allophone of /ku/ before vowels.[17]
There is some evidence that /f/ could have been bilabial, but a labiodental is more likely.[18]
/b, d, g/ represent the fricatives [β, ð, ɣ] between vowels or in contact with /r/ and /l/.[19]
Intervocalic /di, gi/ do not occur, these having previously reduced to /j/.[20][21]
/j/ represents [ɟ] in word-initial position, [ɟɟ~ʝ] intervocalically.[22][23]
The rhotic may have been [ɾ~r], as in Spanish or Catalan.[24]
/ll/ had a retroflex realization: [ɭɭ].[25][26]
/gn/ fricativizes to [ɣn].[27][28]
