# Sound laws

## Original Photetics changes

The phoneme inventory of Primitive Quendian was

    p   t   k
    pʰ  tʰ  kʰ
    b   d   g
    m   n   ŋ
        r,l
            ɣ
    w     j
    a, e, i, o, u, ai, oi, ui, au, eu, iu

An early addition to this repertoire were prenasalised consonants `mb, nd, ŋg` that developped differently in Quenya and Sindarin.

### Sound shifts for Quenya

    pʰ   tʰ   kʰ  -> f   θ   x  (later: θ -> s)
    b-   d-   g-  -> v-  l-  Ø
    -b-  -d-  -g- -> -mb- -nd- -ŋg-
    mb-  nd-  ŋg- -> m-  n-  ŋ-   (later: ŋ- -> n-)

The loss of almost all b's, d's, and g's makes Quenya phonological similar to the Finnish language.

Quenya has some old compounds that preserve the pre-shifted state of a root, e.g., for `dome > lome` "night, darkness" there is an old compund `tindome` and a newer regular one `Aldalome`. This adds to the diachronical depth of the language.

### Sound shifts for Undercommon

    p    t    k   -> b   d   g
    pʰ   tʰ   kʰ  -> v   ð   ɣ (later: ɣ -> Ø)
    mb-  nd-  ŋg- -> b-  d-  g- 
    kʷ  -> k
    w-  -> v

Sindarin also has a lot of lenitations (i.e., in certain contexts the initial consonsonant of a word is changed to some "softer" consonant) inspired by Welsh. The lenitations are different for original `b d g` and `b d g` that come from `mb  nd  ŋg`. Sindarin also has acquired an umlaut `y`.

#### EDIT 3: Evolution of initial `sp-, st-,` and `sk-`

Both in Sindarin and quenya, consonant clusters with an initial s were simplified in two steps: First, the stop became aspirated and the s was dropped

    sp st sk -> ð z ʒ
